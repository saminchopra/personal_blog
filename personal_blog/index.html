				<p>Growing up in New York, I have been fascinated by many different interests. My music choices can vary from electronic, pop music, disney music or rock music.</p>

				<p>I can also like to procrastinate from my work by watching Netflix or scrolling through Facebook for new meme content.</p>

				<p> I can agree with some people, who might think that my interests are weird, but I can proudly say that this is who I am. If people don't like who I am, then tough noodles. Those who do share similar interests with me are more than welcome to peruse this blog that has a montage of what I am interested in. ENJOY!</p>
